              deserve to understand how your information is handled. Where legal
              terms are necessary, we explain what they mean.
            </p>

                <strong>Our Support Team:</strong> Team members may access your
                account on a need-to-know basis to provide support or resolve
                issues.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Service Providers:</strong> We use trusted third-party
                services to help run our app. These include:
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Clerk:</strong> Secure authentication and account management</li>
                  <li><strong>Render:</strong> Cloud hosting and infrastructure</li>
                </ul>
                All service providers are bound by strict data processing
                agreements and only process data as we instruct.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may share information if
                required by law, court order, or to protect the safety of our
                users or the public.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data Security</h2>
            <p>We protect your data with industry-standard security measures:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Encryption:</strong> Your data is encrypted both when
                it's being transmitted (in transit) and when it's stored (at rest).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Secure Authentication:</strong> We use Clerk, a trusted
                authentication provider, for secure sign-in including social
                login options.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Access Controls:</strong> Employee access to user data is
                limited to those who need it to do their jobs, and all access is
                logged.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Regular Security Reviews:</strong> We conduct regular
                security audits and keep our systems updated.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              While we work hard to protect your information, no system is 100%
              secure. We encourage you to use a strong, unique password and keep
              your login credentials private. If you use social sign-in (Google
              or LinkedIn), your account security also depends on those services.
            </p>

            <h2>Data Breach Notification</h2>
            <p>
              In the unlikely event of a data breach that affects your personal

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>
              Accountability EDGE is designed for adults. Our services are
              intended for users who are 18 years of age or older.
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not knowingly collect personal information from children
              under 18. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child
              has provided us with personal information, please contact us at
              support@thirdpeakstudio.com and we will promptly delete that
              information.
            </p>

            <h2>Coaching Is Not Healthcare</h2>
            <p>
              We want to be clear: Accountability EDGE provides professional
              coaching services, not healthcare services.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Coaching is not therapy, counseling, or psychological treatment</li>
              <li>Coaching is not medical advice</li>
              <li>
                Data collected through our app is not protected health information
                (PHI) under HIPAA
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If you're experiencing mental health challenges or need medical
              advice, please consult appropriate licensed professionals. Coaches
              are trained professionals, but they are not acting as therapists
              or healthcare providers.
            </p>

            <h2>Do Not Track Signals</h2>
            <p>
              Some web browsers have a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that sends a
              signal to websites requesting that they not track you. Our
              services do not currently respond to DNT signals because there is
              no industry-standard approach to DNT. However, as described above,
              we don't track you for advertising purposes or sell your data.
            </p>

            <h2>Analytics and Cookies</h2>
            <p>
              Our website may use cookies and similar technologies to understand
              how visitors use our site. These are small text files stored on
              your device. You can control cookies through your browser settings.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our mobile app uses minimal analytics to understand app usage and
              improve our services. We do not use advertising SDKs or cross-app
              tracking technologies.
            </p>

            <h2>Third-Party Links</h2>
            <p>
              Our app or website may contain links to third-party websites or
              services. This Privacy Policy doesn't apply to those external
              sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any
              third-party services you visit.
            </p>

            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>
              We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect
              changes in our practices, technology, or legal requirements.
            </p>
            <p>When we make significant changes, we will:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy</li>
              <li>Notify you through the app or by email</li>
              <li>
                For material changes, give you an opportunity to review the
                changes before they take effect
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Your continued use of our services after changes take effect means
              you accept the updated policy.
            </p>
