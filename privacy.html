              Third Peak Studio respects your privacy. We design our products to
              collect only the data you choose to share and only what is needed
              for app functionality. We never sell your data.
            </p>

            <h2>What we collect</h2>
            <p>
              We collect information you provide directly to us, such as account
              details and any optional inputs you add to the app. We also collect
              limited technical data required to keep the app secure and working
              properly.
            </p>

            <h2>How we use data</h2>
            <p>
              We use your data to deliver app features, improve your experience,
              and support you when you ask for help. Data is used only at your
              discretion and for the purposes you expect.
            </p>

            <h2>Data sharing</h2>
            <p>
              We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties for
              marketing or advertising. We only share data when required to
              deliver the service (for example, trusted infrastructure
              providers), and only with appropriate safeguards.
            </p>

            <h2>Your choices</h2>
            <p>
              You can review, update, or delete your data at any time within
              the app settings. If you need help, contact us and we'll assist.
            </p>
